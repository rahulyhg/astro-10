Publishing In Astro
===================

 * Publishers always edit, move and delete pages in draft mode.
 * Changes must be published for them to take effect on the live site.
 * A page can be published _without_ also publishing changes to its subpages.

Drafts & Revisions
------------------

 * When editing a page, until that page is published, only the latest edits to the draft are saved.
 * Once a page is published, the published version is always available in the revisions history.
